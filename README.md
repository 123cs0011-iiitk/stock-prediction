# Stock Price Prediction System

## 📌 Overview

Stock Price Prediction System is a machine learning-powered application designed to analyze historical stock data and predict future price movements. The system leverages advanced algorithms including K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and ensemble methods to provide accurate predictions through an intuitive web interface.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Stock market volatility and complexity make it challenging for investors to predict future price movements, leading to potential financial losses and missed opportunities in trading decisions. This project addresses these challenges by providing data-driven insights and predictions.

## 💡 Solution

Our system combines multiple machine learning algorithms to analyze:
- Historical stock price data
- Technical indicators and market patterns
- Real-time market data via Yahoo Finance API
- Statistical trends and correlations

The predictions are delivered through an interactive web-based interface, making it accessible to both novice and experienced traders.

## 🚀 Features

- Real-time stock data fetching from Yahoo Finance API
- Historical data analysis and visualization
- KNN-based machine learning prediction model
- Interactive web-based user interface
- Technical indicators and market pattern analysis
- Multiple ML algorithms support (KNN, Linear Regression, ensemble methods)
- Data export and visualization tools
